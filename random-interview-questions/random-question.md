**What is the difference between *==* and *===* in js** <br>
⨀ *==* and *===* both are comparison operation.<br>
⨀ *==* only compare value.<br>
⨀ *===* copares value and types. <br>

```
if('1'== 1){
     //only value
};

<br>

if('1' === 1){
    //value and types
};

```
<br>

What is difference between <b>NULL</b> and <b>UNDEFINED</b>   <br> 
⨀ They both represent empty value, but diffrence is that when u define a variable and not assign a value to it. it automaticly take a placeholder called <b>UndefIned</b>. <br>

⨀ If we try to access typeOf <b>Null</b>  we will get object.
